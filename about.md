Hello there! I'm Ricardo, a penetration tester from Madrid passionate about breaking into things, I've been doing this for about 10 years.

I'm a Telecommunications Engineering graduate from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I also completed a Master's and worked for two years in research. My professional path led me through offensive security roles at Indra and Entelgy Innotec, and I now work as a red teamer at Siemens Smart Infrastructure (Siemens SI).

On this blog, I write about open-source tools from [my Github](https://github.com/ricardojoserf) (most of the time) and hacking techniques I'm learning, largely to create a future reference for myself… because I always forget :)
