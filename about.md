Hello there! My name is Ricardo and I am a penetration tester based in Madrid, Spain, with 9 years of experience. 

I studied Telecommunications Engineering Degree and a Master's Degree in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I worked 2 years as researcher. After that I have worked ~8 years as penetration tester/red teamer in Indra, then Entelgy Innotec and now Siemens Smart Infrastructure (Siemens SI).

I will write about open-source tools from [my Github](https://github.com/ricardojoserf) or hacking techniques I learn, to have a reference in the future... because I always forget :)
